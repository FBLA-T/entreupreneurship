											<h2>About Us</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Our names are Eesha Agrahar and Roschelle D'souza and we are sophomores at Tompkins High School in Katy, Texas. We are part of a club called Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), and as a part of this club, are participating in the American Enterprise Project. We are district winners, and we are now going to represent Houston at the state-level competition. 
										</p>
										<p>Last year, we competed in and placed at nationals for the Community Service Project where we collected about $10,000 dollars and 1.5 tons of supplies to create hurricane supply kits for low-income families in our area. This year, we hope to make as great an impact as we did last year.

									<h2>Mission</h2>
								</header>
								<p>As we know it today, America is built on the entrepreneurial spirit: The spirit of hope and the initiative to become someone great. It is crucial to ensure that this spirit and ambition are passed on to the next generation of Americans; therefore, it is necessary to educate young Americans about the importance of American enterprise, which is especially relevant in such a city like ours. Our city of Katy, a suburb of Houston, has several small businesses started by entrepreneurs looking to gain success, and this perpetuating energy, as demonstrated by local citizens, is what drives our country to greatness.</p>
								<p>So, we worked to raise awareness for the American Enterprise system in several ways for our project. We started by employing the help of our chapter to educate the student body about the American Enterprise system. We also interviewed several business owners and compiled these interviews into one video to play for our chapter to educate them and ourselves about entrepreneurship. We held several educational events to educate children outside of our school about the American Enterprise System and even started our own small business to provide us with first-hand entrepreneurial experience.</p>

									<h2>Our Project</h2>
									<p>For our project, we are interviewing several successful business owners to gain knowledge about entrepreneurship. We started our own business selling chocolate hearts to gain business experience and educate others. We also made and put up posters about this system with the help of our FBLA chapter. Additionally, we set up a booth at our school’s All-Star event to educate students from other schools in our area. To fund our business we set up a garage sale with the help of our chapter and used this as an opportunity to educate the children in our neighborhood.</p>

									<p>The American Enterprise System is America’s free enterprise system that gives power to the people, meaning that individuals — and not the government — own most of our country's resources. </p>
									<p>This system consists of 5 core principles:</p>
									<header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
											<span class="icon major style1 fa-solid fa-crown"></span>
											<h3>Consumer Sovereignty</h3>
											<p>The power of customers to determine whether a business succeeds or fails
											</p>
									</li>
									<li>
											<span class="icon major style2 fa-solid fa-dollar-sign"></span>
											<h3>Profit Motive</h3>
											<p>You are entitled to all profit associated with your property
											</p>
									</li>
									<li>
											<span class="icon major style3 fa-solid fa-users"></span>
											<h3>Competition</h3>
											<p>Businesses can rival each other for success</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style4 fa-briefcase"></span>
										<h3>Private Enterprise</h3>
										<p> The freedom to choose your own business or job
										</p>
								</li>
								<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-key"></span>
										<h3>Private Property Rights</h3>
